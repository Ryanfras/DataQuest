    "\n",
    "We used [Hackernews](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts/home) data to extract only posts which have either Ask HN or Show HN tags. We calculated the average number of comments for each of these types of posts. Next we decided to focus only on Ask HN posts because they were more likely to get comments. Finally we calculated to average number of comments for each hour and sorted from highest to lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can conclude that 15:00 (3PM) is the best time to post Ask HN as this has the highest likelyhood of getting comments. It has almost double the average number of comments compared to the next best time which is 02:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the calculation for average is highly influenced by outliers. Thus, this analysis could have been heavily influenced by outliers i.e. perhaps there was 1 extremely popular post which happaned at 15:00. An alternative calculation we could use is the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that the comments behavior is different for Show HN posts. Hence, this conclusion should not be generalized to all posts. If we do the same analysis for Show HN and get similar results than we could more safely conclude the timing of your post has a influence on number of comments. "
